# Competition Context: Google MedGemma Impact Hackathon

## 1. The Objective
**"Build impactful, agentic applications using the MedGemma family of models."**
The goal is not just to fine-tune a model, but to integrate it into a **workflow** that solves a real-world clinical problem.

## 2. Prize Categories & Strategy
We are targeting a "Full Sweep" strategy by aligning our architecture with multiple distinct prize tracks.

| Prize Track | Value | Our Strategy (TPT System) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agentic Workflow** | **$10,000** | We treat the *entire system* as an Agent. Layer 1 (TDA) senses, Layer 2 (Physics) gates, Layer 4 (MedGemma) reasons. It is a multi-agent system where math is an agent. |
| **Edge AI / Efficiency** | **$5,000** | Our TDA + 2B Model stack is designed for low-power bedside monitors. We run efficiently without massive cloud GPUs. |
| **Novel Application** | **$10,000** | "Topological Vital Signs" is a completely novel task. MedGemma was trained on text, not "Shape Geometry." We are creating a new modality. |

## 3. Judging Criteria
The winners are decided based on a weighted score.

### A. Impact & Utility (40%)
*   **Question**: Does this solve a real problem?
*   **Our Answer**: Sepsis is the #1 hospital killer. Our "Respiratory Rate" and "Instability Detection" limits are directly informed by clinical reality.

### B. Technical Merit (30%)
*   **Question**: Is the engineering impressive?
*   **Our Answer**: We aren't just calling an API.
    *   **TDA**: Mathematical topology (homology).
    *   **PINN**: Physics-informed neural networks.
    *   **KAN**: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks.
    *   **Interactive 3D**: WebGL visualization.
    *   *This is objectively "Hard Engineering".*

### C. Human-Centered Design (20%)
*   **Question**: Is it usable and explainable?
*   **Our Answer**:
    *   **Visuals**: "Bouncing Ball" makes complex math intuitive.
    *   **Trust**: Physics Layer = "We filter hallucinations."
    *   **Transparency**: MedGemma explains its math ("Manifold Radius").

### D. Video Presentation (10%)
*   **Requirement**: 2-minute video.
*   **Our Answer**: We have a scripted "Golden Path" (Hook -> Solution -> Safety -> Proof) designed to maximize this score.

## 4. Key Constraints
1.  **Model Usage**: Must use a Gemma/MedGemma variant.
    *   *We use `google/gemma-2b-it` (Simulated MedGemma) for the demo, with configurability for the real weights.*
2.  **Submission**: Kaggle Notebook or GitHub Repo + Video.
    *   *We have a clean `submission/` folder ready for zip.*
3.  **Data Privacy**: Cannot use restricted data.
    *   *We use generated synthetic waveforms (privacy-safe).*

## 5. The "Winning Meta-Narrative"
Most teams will submit a RAG Chatbot ("Upload your PDF, ask a question").
We are submitting a **Real-Time Computational Biosensor**.
We stand out because we moved **Upstream** (Monitoring/Prediction) rather than **Downstream** (Search/Summary).
