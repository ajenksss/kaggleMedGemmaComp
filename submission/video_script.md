# 🎥 MedGemma TPT: The 2-Minute Demo Script

**Host**: You (The Engineer/CMO)
**Tone**: Urgent, Professional, Technical but Clear.

## 0:00 - 0:20 | The Hook (The "Silent" Signals)
**(Scene: Dashboard. Point to the 'Raw Vitals' chart.)**

**YOU**: "Every ICU monitor tracks the 'Golden Five' vitals: Heart Rate, BP, SpO2, Temp, and **Respiratory Rate**.
Right now, this patient looks stable. BP is fine. But look closer at the **Respiratory Rate**. It's drifting from 16 to 24.
A human might miss that subtle Tachypnea. Our AI doesn't."

## 0:20 - 0:50 | The "Shape" (TDA Layer)
**(Action: Point to the 'Bouncing Ball' Scatter Plot.)**

**YOU**: "This is the **Topological-Physical Twin**. We don't just look at numbers; we look at the *shape* of the physiology.
See this blue ball of dots? That is Homeostasis. It's tight and organized.
**(Action: Wait for the explosion)**
Boom. See that explosion? The ball just shattered. That is 'Topological Instability.' The system detected the crash **60 minutes** before the blood pressure dropped."

## 0:50 - 1:20 | The Filter (Physics Layer)
**(Action: Point to the 'Physics' metric.)**

**YOU**: "But alarms are useless if they are false. That's why we built a **Physics Engine** (PINN) into the loop. 
It uses Fluid Dynamics to check if the data is real. If a sensor glitches, the Physics Layer says 'Impossible' and blocks the alarm.
We solve alarm fatigue by respecting the laws of nature."

## 1:20 - 1:50 | The Agent (Automatic MedGemma)
**(Action: Toggle 'Auto-Reaction' ON. Watch the Red Alert Banner appear.)**

**YOU**: "Finally, we don't just beep. We reason.
When the instability crosses the threshold, our **Event-Driven Architecture** automatically wakes up the **MedGemma Agent**.
It analyzes the 5-dimensional trends and speaks clearly: *'Instability Detected. Flag for Sepsis Protocol.'*
No black boxes. Just clear, physics-verified clinical support."

## 1:50 - 2:00 | The Close
**(Scene: Face Camera)**

**YOU**: "Real-Time. Physics-Gated. And completely transparent.
This is the TPT. We aren't replacing doctors; we're giving them the one thing they can't manufacture: **Time**."
