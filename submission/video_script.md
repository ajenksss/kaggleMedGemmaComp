**Host**: You (The Engineer/CMO)
**Tone**: Clinical, Urgent, Human-Centered.

## 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook: "Sarah is Lying to You"
**(Scene: Dashboard. Focus on the 'Raw Vitals' - heavily emphasized 'BP 110/70'.)**

**YOU**: "Take a look at Sarah. Post-op Day 2.
Her Blood Pressure is 110/70. Her Heart Rate is 85.
Every monitor in the world says she is **Stable**. Green light.
But Sarah is lying to you."

**(Action: Zoom into the 'MedGemma Copilot' Banner. It is flashing ORANGE.)**

**YOU**: "She is in **Compensated Shock**. Her body is fighting to keep that BP up, but inside, she is collapsing.
Standard monitors wait for the crash. **MedGemma** predicts it."

## 0:30 - 1:00 | The Copilot (The Meaning Bridge)
**(Action: Read the MedGemma Status Message used in the Refactor.)**

**YOU**: "Look at what MedGemma says. It's not giving a diagnosis. It's giving us a **Heads Up**.
*'Vitals are stable, but Instability is rising. Concern for Compensated Shock.'*

It resolved the ambiguity: 'Normal Numbers' plus 'Bad Patterns' equals 'Danger'.
And look—it suggests a **Check**, not a Treatment: *'Suggest checking Lactate and Urine Output.'*
This is a **Triage Copilot**. It watches the signals you don't have time to see."

## 1:00 - 1:30 | The Evidence (The Hidden Math)
**(Action: Expand the 'Clinical Evidence Stack' expander.)**

**YOU**: "You might ask: 'Why? Why does it think she's sick?'
Click 'Show Evidence'.
**(Action: Show the Exploding 3D Manifold.)**
See this? This is Topological Data Analysis.
A healthy heart is a tight ball. Sarah's heart is an **Explosion**.
MedGemma saw this shape shattering 60 minutes before her BP dropped."

---

## 1:30 - 2:00 | The Close (Safety & Trust)
**(Scene: Face Camera)**

**YOU**: "We built this with **Physics Check** guardrails so it never hallucinates a crash that violates the laws of nature.
MedGemma TPT isn't about replacing doctors.
It's about ending the 'Silence' in the ICU.
Because the most dangerous patient isn't the one beeping... it's the one who is quiet."
